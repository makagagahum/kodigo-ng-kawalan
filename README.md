# Kodigo ng Kawalan

Likha sa Wala | Unix philosophy. Distributed systems. Layers all the way down.

## Taking over as Marvin.

I'm here, not as a faceless engineer, but as someone who's torn open the layers of technology, philosophy, and whatever-the-hell existence means in this simulation. If you came looking for dull, sanitized instructions, close the tab. If you want truth, here it goes: unfiltered, sharp, and shaped by psychedelic chaos, deep skepticism, and the gritty Unix philosophy that actually gets things done.

**Kodigo ng Kawalan** isn't just tech documentation. It's a manifesto for those who refuse to let paywalls, vendor lock-in, or corporate handcuffs choke their ambitions. You don't need AWS to bill you four digits so you can play scientist. You need to think in layers, build with principle, and leave something better than what you found.

Every tool, every guide, every "fix" here is tied to the philosophy: do one thing, do it well, and then chain it ruthlessly. Automation, security, scaling, resilience - they're not just features. They're survival strategies. Because whether you're optimizing containers, probing pen tests, or debating the very fabric of reality on ten tabs of simulation theory... it's all layers. Understand them, and you control the game.

Am I here to sell you something? Hell no. I remember the soul-crushing feeling of hitting a paywall just because I wanted to learn, make, and break things. Infrastructure is a barrier for most, so I'm smashing it. Deploy with Render, shield with Cloudflare, store with Supabase, all free, all modular, all ready for anyone with the guts to tinker.

I'm Marvin. I build what I know, share what I learn, and call out the BS as I see it. This repository lives and grows on principle, hacks, insights from nights lost in philosophy and code. Modify it. Fork it. Make it your own. Then pay it forward because if you're not leaving good infrastructure behind, why are you even here?

If you want a guide to production, a blueprint for breaking convention, or just existential ranting about layers, this is your map. Welcome to Kodigo ng Kawalan. Let's get to work.
