## ⚠️ Important Notes

✅ **DO:** Learn from these principles and apply them to YOUR business
✅ **DO:** Understand the psychology and adapt it
✅ **DO:** Study the technical patterns

❌ **DON'T:** Copy the code wholesale
❌ **DON'T:** Replicate the design exactly
❌ **DON'T:** Use the same copy or messaging

This is about understanding the **framework**, not cloning the product.

## 🧠 The Core Philosophy

orin.work succeeds because it combines three layers:

1. **Aesthetics** → Visual appeal and brand trust
2. **Function** → Frictionless user experience
3. **Psychology** → Emotional resonance and conversion

Many landing pages nail one or two. orin.work nails all three.
